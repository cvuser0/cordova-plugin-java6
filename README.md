# Java 6 for Android and Amazon-FireOS

This plugin attempts to convince Cordova to compile against Java 6 instead of Java 5 on Java platforms.

**Do only install if you need Java 6 and know why you need Java 6, this is NOT an update for the compiler**

### Installation

    cordova plugin add https://github.com/cvuser0/cordova-plugin-java6.git --link
